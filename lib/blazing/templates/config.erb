# Blazing Configuration File
#
# Sample target definition:
#
#   target <target_name>, <target_location>, [options]
#
# The options provided in the target definition will override any
# options provided in the recipe call.
#
# Options recognized by blazing core:
#   rails_env: used when calling the rake task after deployment

target :staging, 'user@server:/var/www/someproject.com',
       :rails_env => 'production'

# Sample rvm/rbenv/chruby/other setup:
#
#    env_sript <your rvm setup scripts>
#
# Setting an env_script path makes sure it is sourced before the hook
# does anything at all. That way you can setup any environment things
# you need to. Most commonly this will be sourcing rvm and setting a
# ruby, or doing something with rbenv or chruby.
env_script '/etc/profile.d/rbenv.sh'

# Sample rake file config:
#
#     rake <task>, [environment variables]
#
# The provided rake task will be run after blazing has done its stuff.
# Note: you can only call a single rake task. If you need to run several
# tasks just create one task that wrapps all the others.

rake :post_deploy
